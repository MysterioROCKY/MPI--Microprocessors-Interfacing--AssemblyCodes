P1)-asm-> This assembly code defines a global function called `max_ele` that aims to find the maximum element in an array. It starts by initializing a register `rax` with the value of the first element of the array, pointed to by the first argument `rdi`. It then checks if the second argument `rsi` is zero, indicating an empty array, in which case it immediately returns. Otherwise, it enters a loop where it iterates through the array elements, comparing the current element with the current maximum stored in `rax`. If the current element is greater, it updates `rax` with that value. The loop continues until it has compared all elements in the array, and finally, the function returns with the maximum element stored in `rax`.

P1)-c-> This C program is designed to find the maximum element in an array. It includes a `max_ele` function that takes an array of 64-bit integers and its size as arguments and returns the maximum element. In the `main` function, an array `arr` containing a set of integers is defined. The program then calls the `max_ele` function with this array and its size (8) and prints the result, which is the maximum element in the array. In this specific example, the program prints "Maximum element is 102" to indicate that 102 is the highest value in the given array.


P2)-asm-> This assembly code defines a function called `min_ele` that is used to find the minimum element in an array of 64-bit integers. The function takes two arguments: the address of the array (`rdi`) and its size (`rsi`). It starts by initializing the `rax` register with the value at the memory address pointed to by `rdi`, which is assumed to be the first element of the array. It then checks if the size `rsi` is zero; if so, it immediately returns. Otherwise, it enters a loop where it iterates through the array elements, comparing the current element with the current minimum stored in `rax`. If the current element is smaller, it updates `rax` with that value. The loop continues until it has compared all elements in the array, and finally, the function returns with the minimum element stored in `rax`.

P2)-c-> This C program is designed to find the minimum element in an array of 64-bit integers. It includes a `min_ele` function that takes an array of integers and its size as arguments and returns the minimum element. In the `main` function, an array `arr` containing a set of integers is defined. The program then calls the `min_ele` function with this array and its size (8) and prints the result, which is the minimum element in the array. In this specific example, the program prints "Minimum element is -10" to indicate that -10 is the smallest value in the given array. The assembly code for the `min_ele` function performs a linear search through the array elements, keeping track of the current minimum element in the `rax` register, and returns the minimum value found.


P3)-asm-> This assembly code defines a function named `mode` that calculates the mode (the most frequently occurring element) in an array of 64-bit integers. It takes two arguments: the address of the array (`rdi`) and its size (`rsi`). The function first checks if the size is 0 or 1 and handles these cases separately, returning the appropriate result. If there are more elements in the array, it iterates through the array, comparing adjacent elements to find the mode. It uses registers like `rcx` to keep track of the frequency of elements, `r8` to store the maximum frequency found so far, and `rax` to store the mode. The code employs conditional jumps to update the frequency and mode as it processes the array. Ultimately, it returns the mode as its result.

P3)-c-> This C program prompts the user to input the size of an array and its elements, then calculates and prints the mode (the most frequently occurring element) of the provided array. It uses two separate functions, `sort` and `mode`, for these purposes. In the `main` function, the program first obtains the array size and elements from the user, storing them in an array `a`. It then calls the `sort` function to sort the array in ascending order, and the `mode` function to find and return the mode. Finally, it displays the calculated mode to the user.


P4)-asm-> This assembly code defines a function called `median` that calculates the median of an array of 64-bit integers. The function takes two arguments: the address of the array (`rdi`) and its size (`rsi`). It first checks if the size is 0 and returns if so. It then determines if the size is even or odd using bitwise operations. If it's even, it calculates the median by summing the two middle elements and dividing by 2, returning the result in `rax`. If it's odd, it directly calculates the median as the middle element. The code employs various arithmetic and conditional operations to locate the median element's address in memory and perform the necessary calculations. Finally, it returns the calculated median as its result.

P4)-c-> This C program takes user input for the size and elements of an array, then calculates and prints the median (the middle value when the array is sorted) of the provided array. It utilizes two separate functions, `sort` and `median`, for these tasks. In the `main` function, the program first obtains the array size and elements, storing them in an array `a`. It then calls the `sort` function to sort the array in ascending order, and the `median` function to find and return the median. Finally, it displays the calculated median to the user.


P5)-asm-> This assembly code defines a function named `lSearch`, which performs a linear search for a key element within an array of 64-bit integers. The function takes four arguments: the address of the array (`rdi`), the size of the array (`rsi`), the key to search for (`rdx`), and an index (`rcx`). It initializes `rcx` to 0 and compares `rsi` with 0 to check for an empty array; if empty, it returns -1 immediately. Otherwise, it iterates through the array elements in reverse order (from the end to the beginning), comparing each element with the key (`rdx`). If a match is found, it returns the position of the key. If the search is unsuccessful after checking all elements, it returns -1.

P5)-c-> This C program implements a linear search algorithm to find the position of a given key within an array of 64-bit integers. The program first initializes an array `A` and displays its contents to the user. It then prompts the user to input a key to search for within the array. The `lSearch` function is called with the array, its size (8 in this case), and the key as arguments, and it returns the position of the key within the array. Finally, the program prints the position of the key, or -1 if the key is not found, providing a simple example of linear search functionality.
