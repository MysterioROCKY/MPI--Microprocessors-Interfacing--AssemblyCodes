P1)-c-> The provided C code is a simple program for calculating and displaying the result of (a^2 - b^2) where 'a' and 'b' are user-input integer values. It first includes necessary header files and declares a function `squareP` for this calculation. In the `main` function, it prompts the user to input values for 'a' and 'b', then calls the `squareP` function with these inputs and displays the result. The function `squareP` performs the calculation by squaring 'a' and 'b', subtracting them, and returning the result. This program is a straightforward example of user input, function usage, and output in C.

P1)-asm-> The provided assembly code defines a function named `squareP` that calculates (a^2 - b^2) and returns the result. It takes two 64-bit integer parameters 'a' and 'b' and uses registers `r8`, `r10`, `r11`, `rax`, and `r12` for the calculations. The code initializes `r8` with 'a' and `r10` with 'b', then enters a loop where it accumulates 'a^2' in `r11` and 'b^2' in `r12`. After the loop, it subtracts `r12` from `r11`, resulting in 'a^2 - b^2'. Finally, the result is stored in `rax`, and the function returns the value. This code efficiently computes the difference between the squares of 'a' and 'b' without using the 'imul' instruction.

P2)-c-> The provided C code is a program that calculates and displays the result of the expression (a^3 - b^3)/(a + b), where 'a' and 'b' are user-input integer values. It includes necessary header files, declares a function `quotientP`, and defines the `main` function. In the `main` function, it prompts the user to input values for 'a' and 'b, reads the inputs, and then calls the `quotientP` function with these values. The `quotientP` function calculates the expression without using the 'imul' instruction and returns the result. Finally, the program prints the result, which is the outcome of the expression (a^3 - b^3)/(a + b). This code demonstrates user input, function usage, and expression evaluation in C.

P2)-asm-> The assembly code defines the `quotientP` function, which takes two 64-bit integer parameters 'a' and 'b' and computes the expression (a^3 - b^3)/(a + b) without using the 'imul' instruction. It uses registers `r8`, `r9`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `r10`, `r11`, and `rax` for this purpose. The code first calculates 'a^2' and 'b^2', then computes 'a^3' and 'b^3'. Afterward, it subtracts 'b^3' from 'a^3' and calculates 'a + b' without multiplication, storing the result in `rax`. The function returns the result in `rax`.

P3)-c-> This C program calculates and displays the result of "a choose b," which is equivalent to the binomial coefficient C(a, b). It first prompts the user to enter two integer values, 'a' and 'b,' using the standard input. Then, it calls the `chooseP` function, which is implemented to compute the binomial coefficient using efficient assembly code provided earlier. Finally, the program prints the calculated result of "a choose b" to the standard output, providing the user with the binomial coefficient for the given values of 'a' and 'b.

P3)-asm-> This assembly code defines a function named `chooseP` for calculating the binomial coefficient "a choose b" without using the `imul` and `idiv` operations. It begins by handling special cases where the result is known immediately, such as when b is 0, a is less than b, or a equals b. Then, it proceeds to calculate the factorials of 'a' and 'b' using iterative loops, storing the results in registers r8 and r9. It also calculates the factorial of (a - b) and stores it in register r10. To find the result efficiently, it employs a loop for division, subtracting (a - b) factorial from 'a' factorial until further subtraction is not possible, counting the subtractions as the quotient, which is stored in rcx. The final quotient represents "a choose b," and it is returned in the rax register. This code ensures the calculation is done without relying on expensive multiplication or division instructions.
