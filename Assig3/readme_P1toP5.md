P1)-asm-> This assembly code defines a globally accessible function called "Even" that counts the even numbers in an array of 64-bit integers. It uses registers like RAX, RSI, and RDI to manage the loop and a bitwise operation (AND) to check if each integer is even. The function iterates through the array, increments a counter (RAX) for each even number, and returns the count. It stops when it reaches the end of the array or if the array is empty.

P1)-c-> This C program defines a `main` function that initializes an array `A` with ten 64-bit integers. It then calls the `Even` function, passing this array and the size (10) as arguments. The `Even` function, which is declared but not defined in this code, presumably calculates the total count of even numbers in the array and returns the result. The program prints this count using `printf`. In essence, the program calculates and displays the total count of even numbers in the given array, which, in this case, would be the count of even numbers in the `A` array.

P2)-asm-> This assembly code defines a globally accessible 'odd' function that counts the number of odd integers in a 64-bit integer array. It initializes a counter in RAX and iterates through the array, incrementing RAX for each odd integer encountered. The function stops when it reaches the end of the array or if the array is empty, and it returns the count of odd numbers.

P2)-c-> This C program defines a `main` function that initializes an array `a` with ten 64-bit integers. It then calls the `odd` function, passing this array and the size (10) as arguments. The `odd` function, declared but not defined in this code, presumably calculates the total count of odd numbers in the array and returns the result. The program prints this count using `printf`. However, there's a discrepancy in the output message, as it mentions "Total Even Numbers," which is inconsistent with the `odd` function's purpose, which is to count odd numbers.

P3)-asm-> This assembly code defines a globally accessible "PrimeNo" function, which counts the number of prime numbers in an array of 64-bit integers. It starts by initializing a counter in RCX and checks if the input 'n' (number of elements) is zero, jumping to the end if so. The code iterates through the array, checking each element's primality. It employs a nested loop structure, first checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, then if it's equal to 2 (a prime number), and subsequently using a more extensive loop to divide the number by potential divisors, incrementing the counter for each prime found. The function returns the count of prime numbers in RAX.

P3)-c-> This C program calculates the number of prime numbers in an array of integers. It begins by prompting the user to enter the size of the array 'n' and then initializes an array 'arr' with 'n' elements. The user is then prompted to input the values for these array elements. The program calls the 'PrimeNo' function, passing the array and its size as arguments. The 'PrimeNo' function, which is assumed to be previously defined, calculates the count of prime numbers in the array and returns the result. Finally, the program prints the count of prime numbers to the console.

P4)-asm-> This assembly code defines a globally accessible 'gcd' function, which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a sequence of 64-bit integers stored in an array. The function starts by checking the array size and handles special cases when the size is 0 or 1. It then iteratively compares and swaps elements to find the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. The final GCD is stored in RAX, and the function returns it as the result. Additionally, it handles the case of a single-element array and returns the element itself.

P4)-c-> This C program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of integers entered by the user. It starts by prompting the user to input the size 'n' of the array and then initializes an array 'a' with 'n' elements, taking user input for each element. The program then calls the 'gcd' function, passing the array and its size as arguments. The 'gcd' function, which is presumed to be previously defined, computes the GCD of the numbers using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the result. Finally, the program prints the calculated GCD to the console.

P5)-asm-> This assembly code defines a globally accessible 'lcm' function for calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of a sequence of 64-bit integers stored in an array. The function starts by initializing the product as 1 and compares the array size to handle special cases when it's 0 or 1. It then iterates through the array, finding the product of all elements and subsequently computes the GCD of two elements using the Euclidean algorithm. It then calculates the LCM using the product and GCD and updates the result accordingly. Finally, it returns the calculated LCM, considering the special cases of an empty array or a single-element array.

P5)-c-> This C program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of a set of integers entered by the user. It begins by prompting the user to input the size 'n' of the array and then initializes an array 'a' with 'n' elements, taking user input for each element. The program then calls the 'lcm' function, passing the array and its size as arguments. The 'lcm' function, presumed to be previously defined, computes the LCM using a combination of multiplication, GCD calculation, and division. Finally, the program prints the calculated LCM to the console.
