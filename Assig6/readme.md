matrixAdd.c :-> The provided C code implements a matrix addition program. It defines a function matadd that takes two matrices (A and B) represented as one-dimensional arrays, along with the size of the matrices (n*n). The matrices are input by the user and stored in arrays a and b. The matrix addition operation is performed by invoking the matadd function. The result is then printed to the console. The code utilizes Intel x86-64 calling convention, with the matrices represented in row-major order. The input matrices are two-dimensional, but they are stored in one-dimensional arrays for simplicity, with index calculations based on the row and column indices. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the square matrices, inputs the matrix values, performs the addition, and prints the result.

matrixAdd.asm : -> The provided NASM assembly code defines a global function `matadd` that performs matrix addition. It uses the x86-64 architecture. The function takes three parameters: the address of matrix A (`rdi`), the address of matrix B (`rsi`), and the size of the matrices (`rdx`, representing `n*n`). It starts by comparing `rsi` (matrix B) to zero; if it's zero, the function jumps to the `finish` label, indicating the end. Inside the loop labeled `next`, it loads values from matrices A and B, adds them, and stores the result back in matrix A. The loop iterates for `n*n` times (`rcx` is set to `rdx`). The addresses are then incremented by 8 bytes (assuming each matrix element is 8 bytes) in each iteration. Finally, the function returns. The code follows a row-major order, assuming matrices A and B are one-dimensional arrays representing a 2D array in row-major order.

matrixMul.c : -> The provided C code performs matrix multiplication. It dynamically allocates memory for matrices A, B, and C, where A and B are input matrices, and C will store the result. The user is prompted to input the size of the square matrices 'n' and the values for matrices A and B. The matrix multiplication is then performed by the `multiply` function, which takes the matrices A and B, the size 'n', and an array C as parameters. The result is printed to the console. The multiplication is done using three nested loops, with the product of corresponding elements from A and B accumulated in the corresponding position in matrix C. The example test case provided at the end demonstrates the input and output format for a 3x3 matrix multiplication.

matricMul.asm :-> The provided NASM assembly code defines a matrix multiplication function named `multiply`. The function takes three parameters: pointers to matrices A and B (`rdi` and `rsi`), and the size of the matrices (`rcx`, representing 'n'). Matrix C, the result of the multiplication, is assumed to be pre-allocated and pointed to by `rdx`. The code uses several loops to iterate through the matrices and perform the multiplication. The outer loop iterates 'n' times (the size of the matrices), and the inner loops perform the actual multiplication for each element of the result matrix C. The multiplication is done by iterating over a third variable 'k' to calculate the product of corresponding elements from matrices A and B. The result is then added to the appropriate position in matrix C. The code employs indirect addressing to access matrix elements and performs arithmetic operations to calculate the memory addresses. The `addvalue_start` and `innerloop_start` labels mark the beginnings of the respective loops. The code structure reflects the logic of matrix multiplication, with careful management of pointers and indices.
